## About Me

I'm a hydrologist and interdisciplinary researcher currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu) in [Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences](https://geo.msu.edu), where I focus on water resources and policy-relevant research. Drawing on M.S. degrees in [Earth and Environmental Engineering](https://eee.columbia.edu) from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu) and in [Computer and Information Technology](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/) from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu), I apply data-driven approaches that integrate hydrological modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning to tackle water scarcity through both physical and computational perspectives.
