### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Xin (Shane) Lan

I'm a hydrologist and interdisciplinary researcher applying data-driven approaches to tackle water scarcity. My work integrates hydrological modeling, remote sensing, and machine learning to support sustainable water management.

I hold M.S. degrees in Earth & Environmental Engineering from Columbia University and in Computer & Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Ph.D. at Michigan State University in Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences, focusing on water resources and policy-relevant research.
